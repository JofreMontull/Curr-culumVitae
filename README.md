This is a representation of my life, my abilities and my will to work on this as hard as I can.
This is video game is a representation of my skills earned during the career and the experience from another projects.
All the props and assets are from free-use to those ones that I made by myself. 
What is original is the code, the design from the map and the music.

I will try to improve this project until it becomes the perfect presentation.
I hope you enjoy!
